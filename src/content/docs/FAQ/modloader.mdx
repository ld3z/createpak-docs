A. It's more of personal choice really.

## Q. Why use Fabric? Why not Forge, NeoForge, or Quilt?

A. The reasoning for choosing Fabric over Forge, NeoForge, or Quilt is centered around several factors that cater to a more vanilla-like experience and broader mod compatibility. Here’s a breakdown of why:

<Steps>

    1. **Fabric’s Vanilla Feel**: Fabric is known for maintaining the core vanilla experience while allowing modding. It’s lightweight and efficient, without drastically altering how the game functions, which appeals to players who want minimal changes to the base game.

    2. **Forge’s Decline**: Forge, which has been a staple for Minecraft modding for years, has faced criticism in recent times for performance issues and a general lack of optimization. Over the years, the framework has become somewhat bloated, and some modders believe that the community and modding ecosystem are no longer as optimized as they once were.

    3. **NeoForge’s Instability**: NeoForge, a fork of Forge, is still quite new and doesn't yet have the level of support or stability that Forge or Fabric have. The modding community hasn’t widely adopted NeoForge, which leads to fewer mods being compatible or officially supported on this platform.

    4. **Quilt’s Changes**: Quilt, while offering some unique features, changes the game in ways that may not align with every player's preferences. Not all mods are compatible with Quilt, making it a less reliable choice for those who want to ensure maximum compatibility and support.
