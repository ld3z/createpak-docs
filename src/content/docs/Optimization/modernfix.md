ModernFix created by embeddedt is an optimization mod used in this mod pack to help optimize everything about the game.

It is:

> ModernFix is an all-in-one mod that improves performance, reduces memory usage, and fixes many bugs in modern Minecraft versions (most versions including and above 1.16 are supported) without majorly compromising the game experience. Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch roughly twice as fast with ModernFix installed. If some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with 3GB or less of allocated memory.
