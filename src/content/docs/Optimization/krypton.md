Krypton created by *astei* is an optimization mod used in this mod pack to help optimize everything about the game.

It is:

> A Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack.
> Krypton contains several optimizations, including:
- Highly optimized Netty handlers derived from the Velocity proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.
- Flush consolidation to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.
- Micro-optimizations to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.
