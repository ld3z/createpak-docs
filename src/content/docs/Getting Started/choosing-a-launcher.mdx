There are many launchers to choose from when playing modded Minecraft

Some options have more functionality than others. Below is a table of launchers that one could use to play this modpack or any other modpack.

| Name                                                                             | Official                       | Downloads mods using First-Party measures |

| [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/app) :simple-icons-modrinth:                     | :twemoji-check-box-with-check: | :twemoji-check-box-with-check:            |
| [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher)                 | :twemoji-cross-mark:           | :twemoji-cross-mark:                      |
| [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) or [Technic](https://www.technicpack.net/) | :twemoji-cross-mark:           | :twemoji-cross-mark:                      |

:::tip
I would personally recommend [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher) as it allows you to get mods from both CurseForge and Modrinth and allows you to easily get mods that aren't allowed to be downloaded in Third-Party clients.
