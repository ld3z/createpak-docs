There are many launchers to choose from when playing modded Minecraft

Some options have more functionality than others. Below is a table of launchers that one could use to play this modpack or any other modpack.

| [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) or [Technic](https://www.technicpack.net/)                         | <Icon name="twemoji:cross-mark" size="2rem" />           | <Icon name="twemoji:cross-mark" size="2rem" />           |

:::tip
I would personally recommend [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher) as it allows you to get mods from both CurseForge and Modrinth and allows you to easily get mods that aren't allowed to be downloaded in Third-Party clients.
