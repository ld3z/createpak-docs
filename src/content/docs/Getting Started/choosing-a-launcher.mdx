There are many launchers to choose from when playing modded Minecraft

Some options have more functionality than others. Below is a table of launchers that one could use to play this modpack or any other modpack.

| Name                                                                             | Official                                                         | Downloads mods using First-Party measures                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app)                            | <Icon name="approve-check" color="mediumseagreen" size="2rem" /> | <Icon name="approve-check" color="mediumseagreen" size="2rem" /> |
| [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/app)                                             | <Icon name="approve-check" color="mediumseagreen" size="2rem" /> | <Icon name="approve-check" color="mediumseagreen" size="2rem" /> |
| [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher)                 | <Icon name="close" color="darkred" size="2rem" />                | <Icon name="close" color="darkred" size="2rem" />                |
| [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) or [Technic](https://www.technicpack.net/) | <Icon name="close" color="darkred" size="2rem" />                | <Icon name="close" color="darkred" size="2rem" />                |

I would personally recommend [Prism Launcher <Icon name="github" size="2rem" />](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher) as it allows you to get mods from both Curse and Modrinth and allows you to easily get mods that aren't allowed to be downloaded in Third-Party clients.
