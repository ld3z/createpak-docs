There are many launchers to choose from when playing modded Minecraft

Some options have more functionality than others. Below is a table of launchers that one could use to play this modpack or any other modpack.

:::tip
I would personally recommend [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher) as it allows you to get mods from both CurseForge and Modrinth and allows you to easily get mods that aren't allowed to be downloaded in Third-Party clients.
