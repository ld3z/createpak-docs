description: Base version of the Create mod without any addons!
---

We are currently using version 0.5.1 of the Create mod. We are using the Fabric version for the most optimized of this modpack.

That being said, the modpack uses a few addons to enhance the experience. Some of note: [Create Big Cannons](/create/create-big-cannons), [Create Enchantment Industry](/create/create-enchantment-industry), etc.
You can find all of the other addons in the Create section of the documentation.
