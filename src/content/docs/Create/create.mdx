description: Base version of the Create mod without any addons!

import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components";

We are currently using version 0.5.1 of the Create mod. We are using the Fabric version for the most optimized of this modpack.

That being said, the modpack uses a few addons to Create to enhance the experience. Some of note: Create Big Cannons, Create Enchantment Industry, etc.
You can find all of the other addons in the Create section of the documentation.
